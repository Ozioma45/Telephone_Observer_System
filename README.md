# Telephone_Observer_System

This project is a demonstration of implementing the observer design pattern in a telephone package. It allows users to interact with a telephone system through various functionalities such as adding, removing, and dialing phone numbers. Additionally, it maintains a list of observers that are notified whenever a phone number is dialed.
